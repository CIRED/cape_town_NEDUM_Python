    """
    Import number of jobs per income group in each selected employment center.

    Parameters
    ----------
    households_per_income_class : ndarray(float64)
        Exogenous total number of households per income group (excluding people
        out of employment, for 4 groups)
    param : dict
        Dictionary of default parameters
    path_data : str
        Path towards data used in the model

    Returns
    -------
    jobsCentersNGroupRescaled : ndarray(float64, ndim=2)
        Number of jobs in each selected job center (185) per income group (4).
        Remember that we rescale the number of individual jobs to reflect total
        household employment, as our income and population data are for
        households only: one job basically provides employment for two people.
        This simplification allows to model households as a single
        representative agent and to abstract from a two-body problem.
        Empirically, this holds on aggregate as households' position on the
        labor market is often determined by one household head.
