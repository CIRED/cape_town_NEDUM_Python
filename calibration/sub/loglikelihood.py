    Compute composite log-likelihood for model fit given scanned parameters.

    This function computes three separate log-likelihoods that capture the fit
    of the model along distinct data moments. Then, it sums them to give a
    composite log-likelihood that will be maximized to calibrate the utility
    function parameters (as part of scanning or smooth optimization process).
    More precisely, it starts by regressing theoretical values of the log
    amenity index on observed exogenous dummy amenity variables. The first
    log-likelihood is computed based on the value of residuals. Then, it
    defines a second log-likelihood for the fit on income sorting (matching
    observed rents with highest bid-rents from the dominant income group), and
    maximizes it across (unobserved) scale factors. Finally, it gets the
    residuals from the log-difference between theoretical and observed dwelling
    sizes, and computes the third log-likelihood from there.
