    Estimate incomes per job center and number of commuters per distance bin.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param : dict
        Dictionary of default options
    timeOutput : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Duration (in min) of a round trip for each transport mode (5) between
        each selected geographic unit and each selected job center (185)
        centroids
    distanceOutput : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)

        centroids. Note that distances actually do not change across transport
        modes.
    monetaryCost : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Annual monetary cost (in rands) of a round trip for each transport mode
        (5) between each selected geographic unit and each selected job center
        (185) centroids
    costTime : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Daily share of working time spent commuting for each transport mode
        (5) between each selected geographic unit and each selected job center
        (185) centroids. This will be multiplied by expected income to get the
        opportunity cost of time.
    job_centers : ndarray(float64, ndim=2)
        Number of jobs in each selected job center (185) per income group (4).
        Remember that we rescale the number of individual jobs to reflect total
        household employment, as our income and population data are for
        households only: one job basically provides employment for two people.
        This simplification allows to model households as a single
        representative agent and to abstract from a two-body problem.
        Empirically, this holds on aggregate as households' position on the
        labor market is often determined by one household head.
    average_income : ndarray(float64)
        Average median income for each income group in the model (4)
    income_distribution : ndarray(uint16, ndim=2)
        Exogenous number of households in each Small Place (1,046) for each
        income group in the model (4)
    list_lambda : ndarray(float64)
        List of values over which to scan for the gravity parameter used in
        the commuting choice model
    options : dict
        Dictionary of default options

    Returns
    -------
    incomeCentersSave : ndarary(float64, ndim=3)
        Calibrated annual household income (in rands) for each income group (4)
        and each selected job center (185), for each scanned value of the
        gravity parameter
    distanceDistribution : ndarray(float64, ndim=2)
        Share of residence-workplace distances in each 5-km from CBD bracket
        for each scanned value of the gravity parameter
    scoreMatrix : ndarray(float64, ndim=2)
        Ratio of simulated over observed (rescaled) number of jobs for each

        Daily share of working time spent commuting for each transport mode
        (5) between each selected geographic unit and each selected job center

        iteration, per selected job center, rescaled to match income
        distribution across the overall population
    whichCenters : ndarray(bool)
        Dummy variable allowing the narrow selection of job centers used for

        selected job center for each potential SP of residence (1046)
    valueMax : ndarray(float64, ndim=2)

    Compute error and distribution for job allocation simulated from incomes.

    This function leverages the compute_ODflows() function to compute a
    theoretical equivalent to number of jobs in each (narrowly) selected job
    center, and the distribution of those jobs across pre-defined
    distance-from-CBD brackets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incomeCentersTemp : ndarray(float64)
        Hourly household income (in rands) for some income group and some
        iteration, per selected job center
    averageIncomeGroup : float64
        Average hourly median income (from data) for some income group
    popCenters : ndarray(float64)
        Number of jobs in each (narrowly) selected job center for some income
        group. Remember that we further restrict the set of selected job
        centers when calibrating incomes per income group for the sake of
        numerical simplicity. Also remember that we rescale the number of
        individual jobs to reflect total household employment, as our income
        and population data are for households only: one job basically provides
        employment for two people.
        This simplification allows to model households as a single
        representative agent and to abstract from a two-body problem.
        Empirically, this holds on aggregate as households' position on the
        labor market is often determined by one household head.
    popResidence : ndarray(float64)
        Number of households living in each SP (1046), per income group (4):
        comes from census data and does not include people not working
    monetaryCost : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Hourly monetary cost (in rands) of a round trip for each transport mode
        (5) between each selected geographic unit and each selected job center
        (185) centroids
    costTime : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Daily share of working time spent commuting for each transport mode
        (5) between each selected geographic unit and each selected job center
        (185) centroids. This will be multiplied by expected income to get the
        opportunity cost of time.
    param_lambda : float64
        Tested value for the gravity parameter used in the commuting choice
        model
    householdSize : float
        Average number of employed workers per household for one income class
        (corresponds to 2 times the employment rate)
    whichCenters : ndarray(bool)
        Dummy variable allowing the narrow selection of job centers used for
        income calibration for a given income group, among pre-selected job
        centers (185)
    bracketsDistance : ndarray(int32)
        Array of floor values for distance brackets used to select the set of
        incomes + gravity parameter that best fit the distribution of
        residence-workplace distances according to those brackets
    distanceOutput : ndarray(float64, ndim=3)
        Distance (in km) of a one-way trip for each transport mode (5) between

        centroids. Note that distances actually do not change across transport
