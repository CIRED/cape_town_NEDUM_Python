    Estimate parameters by maximizing log likelihood via gradient descent.

    This function runs an interior-point algoithm over values of endogenous
    parameters entering households' utility function, and returns those which
    maximize a composite log-likelihood. The latter is defined as the sum of
    log-likelihoods measuring the fit of the model on several observed data
    moments, namely dwelling sizes, exogenous amenities, and income sorting.
    To compute those separate log-likelihoods, this function calls on the
    calibration.sub.loglikelihood module after providing sample and variable
    selection for the estimation, as well as theoretical partial relations
    from the structure of the model, used in regressions.
    It leverages initial guess from estimate_parameters_by_scanning module on
    parameter values to start within the set of feasible solutions, and to
    converge towards an interior (as opposed to corner) solution.
    The algorithm only converges when considering the fit along all dimensions
    (not only exogenous amenities). This function is therefore not appropriate
    when we want to focus calibration on the amenity score only.

        from data on average land prices, for each SP (1,046)

        Dummy variable used to select SPs (1,046) with enough formal private
        housing to identify the regressions used in the function (less
        stringent than selectedDensity)

        zero)
    initBeta : float64
        Initial guess for the surplus housing elasticity from households'
        utility function: comes from the estimate_parameters_by_scanning module
    initBasicQ : float64
        Initial guess for the basic need in housing (in m²) from households'
        utility function: comes from the estimate_parameters_by_scanning module
    initUti2 : int32
        Target utility level of the second poorest income group
    initUti3 : float64
        Initial guess for the utility level of the second richest income group:

        Initial guess for the utility level of the richest income group:
        comes from the estimate_parameters_by_scanning module
    options : dict

    Returns
    -------
    parameters : ndarray(float64)

        3 and 4
    scoreTot : float64
        Maximum value of composite log-likelihood for the fit on observed
        amenities, dwelling sizes, and population sorting by income: provides
        a performance metric for the calibration process
    parametersAmenities : ndarray(float64)
        List of estimates for the impact of exogenous (dummy) amenities on the
        calibrated amenity index (in log-form). In the order: intercept,
        distance to the ocean <2km, distance to the ocean between 2 and 4km,
        slope between 1 and 5%, slope >5%, being located within the airport
        cone, distance to district parks <2km, distance to biosphere reserve
        <2km, distance to train station <2km, distance to urban heritage site
        <2km
    modelAmenities : regression.linear_model.RegressionResultsWrapper
        Object summarizing the results of the log-regressions of the
        theoretical amenity index over observed exogenous amenity dummies
    parametersHousing : int
        List of estimates related to the fit of the model on building density
        / housing supply: this is not included in this version of the model
        (vector is set equal to zero) as we already exploit this relation to
        estimate parameters of the construction function (compared to other
        versions where we use construction costs)
