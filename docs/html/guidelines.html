<p>Urban shape may be seen as the result of two sets of forces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>State decisions, such as land-use constraints, zoning, transport policies, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple decisions made by firms and inhabitants, through the real-estate and construction markets notably</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The standard urban economic model - as envisioned by <span id="id1">Alonso [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id9" title="W. Alonso. Location and Land Use. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1964.">1964</a>]</span>, <span id="id2">Muth [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id10" title="R. F. Muth. Cities and Housing: The Spatial Pattern of Urban Residential Land Use. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1969.">1969</a>]</span>, <span id="id3">Mills [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id2" title="E. S. Mills. An aggregative model of resource allocation in a metropolitan area. American Economic Review, 57:197-210, 1967.">1967</a>]</span>, and formalized by <span id="id4">Wheaton [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id3" title="W. C. Wheaton. A comparative static analysis of urban spatial structure. Journal of Economic Theory, 57:197-210, 1974.">1974</a>]</span> - aims at analyzing market forces operating under the constraints imposed by state decisions. It showcases three main mechanisms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Households trading off between lower transportation costs and shorter commuting time when living close to the city center (where they work), vs. larger dwellings and lower rents in remote areas</p></li>
<li><p>Local amenities (e.g. a nice view) modulating rents locally</p></li>
<li><p>Investors optimizing housing density as a function of rents and construction costs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to this model, if there is one major city center, rents and population density will be maximum there, and decrease when moving away. To reach this main conclusion (among others), the model makes a number of simplifying assumptions, most of which can be relaxed in more elaborate models to obtain more realistic results (see <span id="id5">Duranton and Puga [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id12" title="G. Duranton and D. Puga. Urban land use. In Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics, pages 467-560. North Holland, Amsterdam, NL, 2015.">2015</a>]</span>) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f1" id="id6">1</a>.</p>
<p>The key hypothesis of this set of models is that, in the long run, land use patterns reach a stationary equilibrium in which (similar) agents share a common utility level. Put in other words, they cannot reach a higher utility level by changing locations, which allows to rationalize the observed land use patterns through optimizing behaviours. It should be noted that, without further assumptions, it is not guaranteed that such spatial equilibrium is indeed optimal in terms of welfare. We therefore need to distinguish between a positive approach (adopted in <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong>) and a normative approach to urban economics.</p>
<p>The interest of such models grounded in economic theory compared to other land use and transport integrated (LUTI) simulation models <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f2" id="id7">2</a> lies in their relative tractability and potential for causal interpretation (<span id="id8">Arnott [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id13" title="R. Arnott. Simulation models for urban economies. In International Encyclopedia of Housing and Home, pages 342-49. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, NL, 2012.">2012</a>]</span>).</p>

<div class="section" id="previous-developments">
<h3>Previous developments<a class="headerlink" href="#previous-developments" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>NEDUM-2D</strong>, for instance, which was initially developed for the Paris metropolitan area (<span id="id9">Viguie <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id5" title="V. Viguie, S. Hallegatte, and J. Rozenberg. Downscaling long-term socio-economic scenarios at the city scale: a study on paris. Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87:305-24, 2014.">2014</a>]</span>), belongs to this category of models. It directly applies a discrete two-dimensional version of the standard urban monocentric model for residential land use with several transport modes (see <span id="id10">Fujita [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id11" title="M. Fujita. Urban Economic Theory. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1989.">1989</a>]</span>) on a grid of pixels, accounting for zoning and land availability constraints defined at the pixel level. This allows for more realistic land use patterns than the basic model with a linear city.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as indicated by its name, <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong> is a dynamic model that accounts for the fact that urban stationary equilibria may not exist: when population, transport prices, or incomes vary, housing infrastructure cannot adapt rapidly to changing conditions and is always out of equilibrium. Such inertia is imposed as a constraint on the theoretical equilibrium, which remains the basis for explaining observed land use patterns.</p>
<p>From its inception, <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong> was also designed to simulate prospective scenarios within the framework of mitigation and adaptation policies at the local scale: urban sprawl, climate vulnerability, as well as transport-related greenhouse gas emissions were included in the model.</p>
<p>In subsequent versions, <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong> has been used within urban contexts as diverse as those of Buenos Aires, Toulouse, Wuhan, London…</p>

<p>More specifically, it considers two types of land and housing informality: informal settlements in predetermined locations (which is akin to squatting as in <span id="id14">Brueckner and Selod [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id8" title="J.

<p>Ongoing work at the <em>World Bank</em> has been focusing on incorporating vulnerability to flood risks in this version of the model, by distinguishing between fluvial, pluvial, and coastal floods. Typically, fluvial floods are one-off, hard-to-predict water overflows from rivers, whereas pluvial floods designate rather seasonal surface water floods or flash floods, caused by extreme rainfall independently of an overflowing water body. Coastal floods encompass hard-to-predict storm surges, periodic tides, and gradual, if uncertain, sea-level rise. The associated risks that we consider include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Structural damages: building depreciation caused by flood damages</p></li>
<li><p>Contents damages: destruction of part of households’ belongings due to floods</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that those are the main channels through which flood risks directly affect the city patterns <span id="id18">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id18" title="R. Pharoah. Examining flood risk in subsidised housing areas in cape town. 2013.">Pharoah, 2013</a>]</span> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fqse" id="id19">4</a>. Agents internalize those risks (or not) by considering the annualized value of those damages (based on probabilistic flood maps) as an added term in the depreciation of their housing capital and of their quantity of goods consumed (assimilated to a composite good) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fmyopic" id="id20">5</a>.</p>
<p>As before, the model allows to simulate how their behaviour might be affected by future demographic, climate, and policy scenarios.</p>

<h3>Mechanisms at play<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanisms-at-play" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Observe that in equilibrium, formal and informal housing markets are connected in several ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is a direct connection due to the fact that, with the exception of subsidized housing beneficiaries who receive a transfer from the State, other poor households optimize across formal and informal residential options until their utilities are equalized.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact that informal settlements and backyarding locations are exogenously determined does not imply that formal and informal housing developments occur in isolation of one another. In fact, they are linked through the choices of poor households across formal and informal housing options, and because formal developers’ building decisions respond to private formal housing prices, which partially reflect the sorting of low-income households across formal and informal housing market segments.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an externality associated with the use of land for informal settlements and for publicly subsidized housing as these areas are somehow taken away from developable land that would otherwise be available for private formal housing. This affects the supply and demand for formal housing by restricting the set of potential locations available for private formal development, while accommodating a potentially large number of urban residents in the informal sector <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f4" id="id21">6</a>.</p>
<p>The main added mechanism from flood risk anticipation is that the poorest households might trade-off protection from flood risks for cheaper housing and better accessibility. Our preliminary results indeed show a tendency for informal settlements to expand in the near future (land-use regulations allowing), thereby increasing the vulnerability of the affected populations in absence of any mitigating investments. Note that, if the consequences in terms of residential segregation are clear, the consequences in terms of aggregate welfare are less straighforward due to the interactions described above, and would require a dedicated study (see <a class="reference internal" href="use_case.html"><span class="doc">Use case</span></a> for an exemple).</p>

<div class="section" id="interpretation-of-results">
<h3>Interpretation of results<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretation-of-results" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>It should be noted that prospective scenarios only represent conceivable futures that may inform cost-benefit analysis, and have no predictive value per se, as many phenomena are neglected to preserve tractability</strong>.</p>
<p>As such, <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong> only makes predictions with respect to some simplifying assumptions (exogenous land availability and subsidized housing, etc.) and some economic mechanisms (housing supply and demand) described above <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f5" id="id22">7</a>. Although it is calibrated to stick closely to reality at present time, the number of parameters fed into the model is restricted to avoid overfitting and extreme sensitivity of the outputs to initial conditions.</p>
<p>Indeed, the aim of such a model is to provide simulations for the future, with the largest external validity possible in the absence of observable counterfactuals. For them to be informative, they need to display complex direct and indirect effects while keeping tractable the mechanisms that cause them, hence the need to restrict the number of such mechanisms that are interacting in equilibrium.</p>
<p>Here, <strong>NEDUM-2D</strong> preserves the main market mechanism from the standard urban economic model, while allowing for sorting across different housing submarkets. If one is interested in the impact of other mechanisms on land use patterns (such as homophilia), one should probably consider another model (for instance, a tipping segregation model à la <span id="id23">Schelling [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id28" title="T. Schelling. Dynamic models of segregation. The Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1:143-86, 1971.">1971</a>]</span>).</p>
<p>Empirically, <span id="id24">Liotta <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id20" title="C. Liotta, V. ViguiÃ©, and Q. Lepetit. Is the monocentric urban economic model still empirically relevant? assessing urban econometric predictions in 192 cities on five continents. 2021.">2021</a>]</span> show that the standard urban economic model has a good predictive power in terms of population density and rent variations, but not so much in terms of housing production. However, they also show that high levels of informality, strong regulations and planning, as well as specific amenities are, as expected by the theory, main factors leading to the discrepancies. As we account for those elements, we believe that our model yields relatively good predictions. <strong>Still, as is common approach in the literature, we think that the biggest strength of our model is not to deliver predictions in absolute terms, but rather comparative statics that relate one scenario to another, and that are less sensitive to misspecifications.</strong></p>

<dd><p>Contrary to the so-called “Quantitative Spatial Economics” literature <span id="id28">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id19" title="S.J. Redding and E. Rossi-Hansberg. Quantitative spatial economics. Annual Review of Economics, 9:21-58, 2017.">Redding and Rossi-Hansberg, 2017</a>]</span>, we do not endogenize employment locations, to the extent that we do not allow firms to compete with households for land. There are two main reasons for that. First, the (relative) numerical simplicity of our model allows us to deal with several dimensions of heterogeneity within an extremely granular setting. Second, survey data and expert opinion do not lead us to consider flood risks as a major potential shifter for job center distribution across the city. Since this is the focus of the current version, we therefore keep this distribution as fixed (more on that in <a class="reference internal" href="technical_doc.html"><span class="doc">Technical documentation</span></a>) to focus on the direct mechanism described above. Then, our approach also comes with benefits of its own: we are able to model an endogenous city edge through the agricultural land (which is empirically relevant in a developing city context), and to simulate more realistic spatial sorting patterns through continuous (as opposed to unit) demand for housing, which is taken as a necessity good (more on that in <span id="id29">Gaigne <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id33" title="C.

However, we would need a more general equilibrium model (with production, trade, etc.) to study the indirect impact of floods on overall economic activity (through infrastructure disruptions for instance, see <span id="id30">Hallegatte <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id27" title="S.

We believe that our approach is better suited to the study of (more general) extreme flood events that impact the value of land but do not lead to its permanent abandonment. This echoes our focus on within-city commuting rather than cross-city migrations (which we take as exogenous). Finally, note that all those studies abstract from modelling the economic cost of human life, which is probably to be non-negligible but is also hard to measure and subject to behavioral biases: in any case, incorporating such margin is only likely to reinforce our findings on spatial sorting.</p>

<dd><p>The net effect on formal housing prices is ambiguous as the restricted supply of formal land should raise formal housing prices in the center, while pushing away population to peripheral areas where prices will be lower. At the same time, housing in the informal sector reduces the demand for formal housing, which exerts a downward pressure on formal housing prices.</p>
