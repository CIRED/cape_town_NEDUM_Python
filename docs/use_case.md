# Use case

## Past use cases

Within the context of the CoCT, Pfeiffer *et al.* [[2019](#id6)] have been studying two policy use cases.


* The impact of an urban growth boundary over population density and sorting across housing markets


* The impact of public housing provision scenarios on spatial sorting of poor households through the backyarding channel

## Current use case

In the current implementation, we add flood risk anticipations to the model and discuss policies that mitigate the associated damages within a framework in which agents adapt their behavior. We focus on land-use policies, and more specifically on informal settlement expansion scenarios. Note that we could, in theory, assess the impact of a variety of other policies, such as localized flood protection investments (in the spirit of Avner *et al.* [[2021](#id21)]). To conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis however, this would require updated flood maps reflecting the change in risks before and after the policy on the benefit side, and engineering studies of the involved projects on the cost side. We leave that for future work but just mention that it is a possibility.
