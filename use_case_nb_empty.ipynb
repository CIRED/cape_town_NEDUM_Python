    "Our model allows us to compare two polar cases: one in which agents (both on the supply and demand sides of  the housing market) perfectly anticipate flood risks (based on existing global flood maps), and the other where they do not at all take them into account. Note that anticipations here can be understood as a mechanism of self-insurance whereby agents perfectly smooth consumption across states of the world by systematically paying for the expected cost of flood damages in any given year: we recall that ours is a static equilibrium model calibrated for baseline year 2011 (for which census data is available)."

    "It can be shown that self-insurance is a substitute for market insurance: our use case therefore boils down to comparative statics between perfect risk-based insurance - while remaining agnostic about the practical mix of schemes involved - and no insurance. It can also be shown that other ex-ante flood managements strategies - namely zoning and subsidized insurance - are second-best options that are easier to implement and less technically demanding, yet yield similar welfare gains. This adds to the generality of our findings."

    "We want to make clear from the outset that we do not aim at explicitly modelling insurance choice and/or belief formation, but rather at showing their distributional welfare consequences within an urban economics framework that converges towards a long-run equilibrium. The current reality may be expressed as a convex combination of our two polar cases, and the difference in outcomes between the two should be interpreted as an upper bound on the achievable welfare gains/losses from implementing the corresponding policy. Also note that protection investments (either self-provided, market-based, or state-funded) are not modelled here and would require a separate use case, as they act like a complement to insurance."

    "Our model allows us to distinguish between fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flood risks. Fluvial and pluvial flood risks are based upon FATHOM global flood maps, and coastal flood risks upon DELTARES global flood maps. Those maps are merged with the *City of Cape Town* (CoCT) analysis grid to obtain estimates of flood-prone area share and maximum flood depth levels for distinct return periods (corresponding to probabilities of ocurrence in any given year), at the grid cell level (500x500m). For reference, the climate conditions used to produce the flood maps are the ones prevailing in 2018, which we assume to be roughly in line with the ones prevailing at our baseline year. Also, our geographic units are 30 times bigger than the units used in the raw flood maps, hence we consider them as being of good enough quality for what we define as the \"local\" level. Then, this information is converted into an expected fraction of capital destroyed, leveraging estimates from the insurance literature. This measure varies across damage type (either building structures or good contents stored at home) and building materials (hence housing types) for damages on structures. The spatial distribution of such depreciation rate is shown below for damages on contents (which do not vary across housing types)."

The distribution of its intensity is not obvious a priori however. Note that this is only a first step towards quantifying damages, as their final value also depends on the housing choices made by households: highly exposed but low-density areas such as the West front of the peninsula should feature relatively low damages. Also note that the flood maps used to calibrate this variable are so-called \"undefended\" flood maps. This means that they do not take into account existing infrastructure that may affect the spatial distribution of flood risks (as assessing this dimension on a global scale would provide noisy estimates at best). This is why we prefer to intepret our results in changes, rather than in levels: all else equal (including existing infrastructure), what is the impact of a change on a given dimension (for instance, insurance) over outcomes of the model?

    "Several comments are in order. First, damages in formal housing are consistently bigger than in informal housing, and damages on structures also tend to outweigh damages on contents. This is because capital value of informal settlements / backyards is calibrated based on construction costs and is fairly low (hence the relative importance of contents in this category), whereas capital value of formal private housing (that is capital-intensive and can be built on several floors) is endogenously determined through supply and demand, and can get pretty high in dense locations. The bulk of overall population lives in formal private housing too, hence the observed results in spite of informal settlements / backyards being less protected from floods. Besides, informal housing dwelling units do not appear to be systematically located in zones with high flood exposure, contrary to what one may think at first. The capital value of formal subsidized housing structures is also calibrated based on construction costs but is typically higher than for informal housing. Finally, the population living in formal private housing is essentially made up of households belonging to the two richest income groups, with the two poorest concentrating in the other housing categories. Their higher amount of income available for consumption explains the relative importance of content damages in this category."

    "Second, damages are higher in the no-insurance case than in the perfect-insurance case. This is to be expected given optimality conditions. The insurance margin also seems to play a relatively more important role in the formal private housing sector. This can be explained by the fact that it is the least constrained of the housing submarkets, either in terms of available locations, or supply and demand. What is more surprising is the differential role insurance seems to play across flood types. Again, this can be interpreted in terms of existing constraints. Pluvial flood zones are typically more dispersed than fluvial or coastal flood zones, hence are harder to avoid (the extensive margin). Independently, coastal flood zones are typically more valuable, hence a floor below which demand would not fall (the intensive margin)."

    "Third, damages also significantly vary in their magnitude across flood types:\n",
    "- Total fluvial damages amount to roughly 280M ZAR (2011) with insurance and 570M ZAR (2011) without insurance (**+104%**)\n",
    "- Total pluvial damages amount to roughly 145M ZAR (2011) with insurance and 165M ZAR (2011) without insurance (**+14%**)\n",

    "\n",
    "Using an inflation rate of 64% over the 2011-2021 period, and an exchange rate of 14.78 ZAR/USD, we get the following:\n",
    "- Total fluvial damages amount to roughly 31M USD (2021) with insurance and 63M USD (2021) without insurance\n",
    "- Total pluvial damages amount to roughly 16M USD (2021) with insurance and 18M USD (2021) without insurance\n",
    "- Total coastal damages amount to roughly 6M USD (2021) with insurance and 8M USD (2021) without insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, a 2021 report by the World Bank (\"Flood Risk and Resilience of Coastal Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa\") gives values of 16M USD for rainwater (both fluvial and pluvial) flood damages, and 370,000 USD for coastal flood damages. The difference between the two estimations is essentially a question of methodology. Let us start by saying that, due to partial overlap, an exact estimation of rainwater flood damages cannot just be obtained as the sum of fluvial and pluvial flood damages in our case. Taking the maximum between the two in each grid cell, we obtain a value of 389M ZAR (2011) / 43M USD (2021) with insurance, and 675M ZAR (2011) / 75M USD (2021) without insurance (+74%). This is still a substantial overestimation for both flood types, especially coastal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the report uses essentially the same flood maps as ours for rainwater flood risks, as well as the same Extreme Sea Level (ESL) inputs for coastal flood risks, albeit not the same Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used to spatialize discrete inputs. This should not generate a dramatic difference however. Urban exposure is based upon 2015 data, which we deem close enough to our 2011 baseline, and all construction is also considered as residential, since this is the most common building type. On that point, it is worth noting that both approaches only yield estimates of direct flood costs, and not indirect ones such as transport disruption, business losses, or loss of family income (which are shown to be important in the World Bank 2019 \"Lifelines\" report).\n",
    "\n",
    "Damage vulnerability curves (used to translate maximum flood depth into fraction of capital destroyed) are slightly different, but also in the same range. On that point, we actually think that we are improving on the report's estimates, since we are using different functions to account for the variety of building materials used in structures, and the separate exposure of house contents. Besides, our depth-damage functions for structures were calibrated for the African context (as in the report), and the functions for contents were calibrated for the South African context more specifically, taking into account the cap on damageable share that is advocated for in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference lies in the way the underlying value of vulnerable assets is estimated. The report uses satellite imagery to determine the extent of urban exposure, and multiplies this area by a (unique) maximum unitary damage value per m². Final damage estimates are then obtained by applying the depth-damage function to this total maximum value in each location . In contrast, urban extent and unitary value of underlying structures and contents are endogenous outcomes in our model: the city can be built on several floors, underlying values are heterogeneous, and can become very high in valuable areas. In fact, for a similar urban coverage, we find a total capital value for formal private housing structures that is very close to their estimate of the total exposed capital value of the city: since this is the housing category that drives most of the damages in absolute terms, our differences in results boil down to the way those values are distributed across the city in our model (they are typically high along the coast and in some flood-prone zones where there is high demand) and the value of associated contents, which we think is underestimated in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an element of comparison, the maximum unitary damage value they consider in the report (24.6 USD, 2021) is almost the same as the one we calibrate for the capital value of one surface unit of an informal \"shack\" (23.78 USD, 2021). We think this is too low to reflect the average capital value of the city, and one would find damage values even bigger than our estimates by using the same methodology with a higher reference point, such as the one taken for South Africa in the 2017 JRC technical report (\"Global flood depth-damage functions\") that they cite (765 EUR, 2010 ; that is 1,018 USD, 2021 with 12% inflation and a 0.845 exchange rate). We therefore consider to be in the middle range."

In theory, welfare comparison is done by comparing (consumer) surplus across scenarios. However, this requires to fully back up supply and demand functions, which is often impossible without strong assumptions. What is usually done in such case is to come up with an income compensation scheme  (either through compensating or equivalent variations) that would make households indifferent across scenarios. Conditional on residential location, (group-specific) income net of commuting costs is a state variable that only affects utility through the budget constraint (as opposed to consumption choices on housing and composite good): we therefore consider it to be the relevant margin for a compensation scheme. Still, since we do not have an analytical solution for utilities (which are determined as a simulation outcome), we would need to rewrite a (computationally intensive) algorithm to optimize over the values of income net of commuting costs (that vary across income group and city space) needed to reach a target utility level, given initial conditions.\n",

Besides, since we consider non-homothetic preferences with taste shocks, change in utilities does not directly identify equivalent (or compensating) variation, but only approximates it up to the first order. Since we are not studying infinitesimal changes here, we do not consider it to be a satisfying approximation.\n",

    "Here is our interpretation:\n",
    "- Overall exposure to flood risks decreases with income (conditional on income group population), even when flood risks are not taken into account (no-insurance case). This corresponds to the intuition that flood-prone areas are typically low-amenity areas located far from (high) income centres, as public services and economic activity historically developed away from them.\n",
    "- More counter-intuitively, the tail of flood vulnerability does not necessarily becomes thinner as income increases. We see that as the outcome of two counteracting forces: on the one hand, the denominator effect of higher income is expected to offset the numerator effect of higher values in exposed structures and contents ; on the other, as marginal utility is decreasing with income, richer households may prove less sensitive to a change in incomes.\n",
    "- The very long (but thin) tail of flood damages for income group 1 (with some households losing more than 100% of their income) is due to a few households living in formal subsidized housing that are located in flood-prone areas, as the cost of such housing structures is relatively high (compared to their income or the capital value of an informal \"shack\"). This is sustained in our model since we assume that all poor households would sort into such housing (when given the choice) due to their poor outside options. In practice, this would require the public planner to bail out such households. In any case, this does not affect our comparative statics, which is our key focus here (we recall that formal subsidized housing is exogenous).\n",

    "We see that the areas with the biggest changes in rents roughly correspond to inflow/outflow areas in the Cape Flats and distant suburbs. This makes sense as market rents reflect the willingness to pay of the highest-bidding income groups in the model. As outflow areas typically are high-risk flood zones (compared to inflow areas which typically are not flood zones), this reflects the updated valuations after introducing insurance (note that % change is set equal to zero in hover data when there are no households to compare to in one of the scenarios, as in previous maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flood zones closer to the city center (and in some coastal locations) typically feature smaller (yet significant) changes in rents, even when they are as exposed as zones located farther away. This corresponds to the intuition already mentioned that, since those typically are high-value areas, demand would not fall below a certain level, all the more so as households living there can afford to pay for flood damages. Consequently, they do not showcase substantial population flows. Population flows and rent changes sometimes even go in the opposite direction, as some households are willing to take advantage of lower rents. Likewise, if a fall in rent typically translates into a rise in housing consumption, it is not always the case (if households want to save on flood damages, for instance).\n",

    "We now take the full-insurance scenario as our baseline and simulate the effects of climate change. For coastal flood risks, we rely on specific flood maps provided by DELTARES, based upon IPCC's RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5 scenario projected onto 2050. Since FATHOM does not provide similar flood maps for rainwater flood risks, we consider dummy scenarios where we multiply all yearly probabilities by 2 (that is, we divide return periods by 2) for such flood types. Although we do not simulate the changes in affected areas in that case, we believe it is a good enough approximation since they are not likely to change much (as is the case when incorporating sea-level rise in coastal flood maps). Then, we picked the likelihood ratio to simulate changes in rainwater flood risks aligned with changes in coastal flood risks. This also appears when plotting the changes in flood capital depreciation, as we show below (for content damages)."

This masks less important (but still relevant) rent decreases East of the City Bowl and around Sunset Beach, following increases in flood risks. Those are not massive emigration areas, and households do seem to increase their housing consumption there: this explains the high damage values in absolute terms, at the same time as the low values in relative terms (rich households living there can afford to pay for flood damages). In other areas where rent does not move much, there is actually little response: households merely bear the changes in costs without adapting much."

In the first zone, households move from one place to another so as to mitigate the rise in flood damages (as shown in the relative flood damage map). In the second zone, households do not seem to move much, and the rise in damages is mitigated by the fall in capital value (that is not compensated by a higher housing consumption). This is in line with the intuition that poor households are more sensitive to flood damages due to financial constraints."
