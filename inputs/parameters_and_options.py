    Convert agricultural land price into theoretical annual housing rent.

    The conversion leverages the zero profit condition for formal private

    Parameters
    ----------
    rent : float
        Parametric agricultural land price at baseline year (2011)
    scale_fact : float
        (Calibrated) scale factor for the construction function of
        formal private developers
    interest_rate : float
        Parametric interest rate at baseline year (computed as the
        average over previous years)
    param : dict
        Dictionary of default parameters
    options : dict
        Dictionary of default options

    Returns
    -------
    agricultural_rent : float64
        Theoretical agricultural (annual) rent (corresponds to opportunity
        cost of non-urbanized land)
