Note that anticipations here can be understood as a mechanism of self-insurance whereby agents perfectly smooth consumption across states of the world by systematically paying for the expected cost of flood damages in any given year: we recall that ours is a static equilibrium model calibrated for baseline year 2011 (for which census data is available)."

    "Our model allows us to distinguish between fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flood risks. Fluvial and pluvial flood risks are based upon FATHOM global flood maps, and coastal flood risks upon DELTARES global flood maps. Those maps are merged with the *City of Cape Town* (CoCT) analysis grid to obtain estimates of flood-prone area share and maximum flood depth levels for distinct return periods (corresponding to probabilities of ocurrence in any given year), at the grid cell level (500x500m). For reference, the climate conditions used to produce the flood maps are the ones prevailing in 2018, which we assume to be roughly in line with the ones prevailing at our baseline year. Also, our geographic units are 30 times bigger than the units used in the raw flood maps, hence we consider them as being of good enough quality for what we define as the \"local\" level. Then, this information is converted into an expected fraction of capital destroyed, leveraging estimates from the insurance literature. This measure varies across damage type (either building structures or good contents stored at home) and building materials (hence housing types) for damages on structures. The spatial distribution of such depreciation rate is shown below for damages on contents (which do not vary across housing types)."

This means that they do not take into account existing infrastructure that may affect the spatial distribution of flood risks (as assessing this dimension on a global scale would provide noisy estimates at best).

    "Several comments are in order. First, damages in formal housing are consistently bigger than in informal housing, and damages on structures also tend to outweigh damages on contents. This is because capital value of informal settlements / backyards is calibrated based on construction costs and is fairly low (hence the relative importance of contents in this category), whereas capital value of formal private housing (that is capital-intensive and can be built on several floors) is endogenously determined through supply and demand, and can get pretty high in dense locations. The bulk of overall population lives in formal private housing too, hence the observed results in spite of informal settlements / backyards being less protected from floods. Besides, informal housing dwelling units do not appear to be systematically located in zones with high flood exposure, contrary to what one may think at first. The capital value of formal subsidized housing structures is also calibrated based on construction costs but is typically higher. Finally, the population living in formal private housing is essentially made up of households belonging to the two richest income groups, with the two poorest concentrating in the other housing categories. Their higher amount of income available for consumption explains the relative importance of content damages in this category."

    "Second, damages are higher in the no-insurance case than in the perfect-insurance case. This is to be expected given optimality conditions. The insurance margin also seems to play a relatively more important role in the formal private housing sector. This can be explained by the fact that it is the least constrained of the housing submarkets, either in terms of available locations, or supply and demand. What is more surprising is the differential role insurance seems to play across flood types. Again, this can be interpreted in terms of existing constraints. Pluvial flood zones are typically more dispersed than fluvial or coastal flood zones, hence are harder to avoid (the extensive margin). Independently, coastal flood zones are typically more valuable, hence a floor below which demand would not fall (the intensive margin)."

The difference between the two estimations is essentially a question of methodology. Let us start by saying that, due to partial overlap, an exact estimation of rainwater flood damages cannot just be obtained as the sum of fluvial and pluvial flood damages in our case. Taking the maximum between the two in each grid cell, we obtain a value of 389M ZAR (2011) / 43M USD (2021) with insurance, and 675M ZAR (2011) / 75M USD (2021) without insurance (+74%). This is still a substantial overestimation for both flood types, especially coastal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the report uses essentially the same flood maps as ours for rainwater flood risks, as well as the same Extreme Sea Level (ESL) inputs for coastal flood risks, albeit not the same Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used to spatialize discrete inputs. This should not generate a dramatic difference however. Urban exposure is based upon 2015 data, which we deem close enough to our 2011 baseline, and all construction is also considered as residential, since this is the most common building type. On that point, it is worth noting that both approaches only yield estimates of direct flood costs, and not indirect ones such as transport disruption, business losses, or loss of family income (which are shown to be important in the World Bank 2019 \"Lifelines\" report).\n",
    "\n",
    "Damage vulnerability curves (used to translate maximum flood depth into fraction of capital destroyed) are slightly different, but also in the same range. On that point, we actually think that we are improving on the report's estimates, since we are using different functions to account for the variety of building materials used in structures, and the separate exposure of contents. Besides, our depth-damage functions for structures were calibrated for the African context (as in the report), and the functions for contents were calibrated for the South African context more specifically, taking into account the cap on damageable share that is advocated for in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference lies in the way the underlying value of vulnerable assets is estimated. The report uses satellite imagery to determine the extent of urban exposure, and multiplies this area by a (unique) maximum unitary damage value per m². Final damage estimates are then obtained by applying the depth-damage function in each location to this total maximum value. In contrast, urban extent and unitary value of underlying structures and contents are endogenous outcomes in our model: the city can be built on several floors, underlying values are heterogeneous, and can become very high in valuable areas. In fact, for a similar urban coverage, we find a total capital value for formal private housing structures that is very close to their estimate of the total exposed capital value of the city: since this is the housing category that drives most of the damages in absolute terms, our differences in results boil down to the way those values are distributed across the city in our model (they are typically high along the coast and in some flood-prone zones where there is high demand) and the value of associated contents, which we think is underestimated in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an element of comparison, the maximum unitary damage value they consider in the report (24.6 USD, 2021) is almost the same as the one we calibrate for the capital value of one surface unit of an informal \"shack\" (23.78 USD, 2021). We think this is too low to reflect the average capital value of the city, and one would find damage values even bigger than our estimates by using the same methodology with a higher reference point, such as the one taken for South Africa in the 2017 JRC technical report (\"Global flood depth-damage functions\") that they cite (765 EUR, 2010 ; that is 1,018 USD, 2021 with 12% inflation and a 0.845 exchange rate). We therefore consider to be in the middle range."

Ex-ante, the same applies to the no-insurance case, with utility levels that are higher for all income groups since households live in a no-flood world. Ex-post, the discovery of the flood damages associated with their location and housing choices is going to differentially affect their utilities (which will be typically lower than in the full-insurance case for exposed households): the spatial indifference condition does not hold anymore as we do not allow households to sort again."

    "It is worth noting that, since utility is an ordinal (as opposed to cardinal) concept, we cannot quantitatively interpret the difference in utility levels across scenarios: we may simply say that some households are made worse off or better off, but not by how much. What we can do is to come up with an income compensation scheme that would make households indifferent across scenarios. Conditional on residential location, (group-specific) income net of commuting costs is a state variable that only affects utility through the budget constraint (as opposed to consumption choices on housing and composite good): we therefore consider it to be the relevant margin for a compensation scheme. Since it is heterogeneous across space (see appendix on the resolution of the commuting choice model for more details), it may not be possible to assign a unique compensation rate to all households (who may sort) within one income group, as this equilibrium may fail to exist. However, we may do it (at least theoretically) on a geographic basis: this is exactly what is given by the difference in flood damages (as a % of net income), for different housing types (that have different flood vulnerability), between the full-insurance and the no-insurance cases, that we plot below."
